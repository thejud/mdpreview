## Features

- ✅ Local images are automatically copied to cache
- ✅ Remote images (http/https) are left as-is
- ✅ Supports common formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP
- ✅ Preserves directory structure in cache
- ✅ Shows warnings for missing images

The image support makes mdpreview more useful for documentation that includes diagrams, screenshots, and other visual content!
